# IsPalindrome
This program was created to check if a word is a palindrome without using the reverse string function. First a variable called palindrome is created and set to false. By setting the variable to false, we are able to create a condition in which it can be verified true after a for loop's complete iteration. Iterating through a for loop we set the variable, palindrome, to true if each letter in two words are perfectly mirrored when compared while palindrome remains false for all other possibilities. This distinction between true and false allows an if statement to print a response to the user. Showing that it is possible to check for palindromes without reverse string functions.
